# ECO WARRIERS - PROJECT 2

<h1> Video demonstration </h1>

<h1> Project Description </h1>
Building an interactive unity game in order to build a village by making it rain artificially using Jet plane by showering chemicals on the clouds to seed clouds to get the water for the villagers. Also finding the already existing water resources in the area. Storing the rain water into the lake by creating aqueducts from river stream generating by raining and cleaning the water resource(lake) so that lake water can be kept clean which can be used by villagers.



<h1> Contributers </h1>
<ul>
  <li>Bouligny, Jonathan </li>
  <li>Datta, Prerit</li>
  <li>Pardeshi, Amitsingh</li>
</ul>
 

<h1> Technologies Used </h1>

<ul>
  <li>Unity </li>
  <li>Oculus Rift Controller</li>
  <li>C# Scripts</li>
</ul>
 


<h1> Challenges Faced </h1>

<ul>
  <li>Integration with oculus hardware - This was the biggest issue we faced as a team becasue we did had limited access to Oculus hardware during develpment process. During the testing phase of the project we had to fix lot many hard integration issues which were time consuming. </br>
  Lesson Learnt - Always test your code in chunks on the actual hardware rathar than devloping entire application and then testing on actual hardware.
  <li> Learning Curve - As we were new to the unity, the learning curve was steep and team has to spend lot of time learning the technology.</li>
  <li>Repository management - Using GIT for code repository was not helpful. Instead, we went for Unity Collaborators for repository manamgement after servaral failed attempt with GIT.</li>
</ul>

<h1> How To Play</h1>

<h3>Clouds Level</h3>
Use the plane to spray chemical on the clouds above to make the thunder which in turn will lead to artificial rain. Once the player is successfully able to seed certain number of clouds( which is configurable in our code) the player clears this level.
<br>
Initial Cloud Scene where player can see.
<ul>
  <li>Time Remaining</li>
   <li>Players Health</li>
   <li>Chemical Tank Reading</li>
   <li>Clouds seeded</li>
</ul>

Use oculus Rift controller to operate the plane.
<ul>
  <li>Joy Stick to move plane left and right</li>
  <li> Press key Y to release chemicals.
</ul>

Use Keyboard to operate the plane on PC.
<ul>
  <li>WASD - To Move plane</li>
  <li> Press space key to release chemicals.
</ul>

<h3>Build Aquaduct & Clean Lake Level</h3>
Player will have to solve the puzzle by arranging pieces to build an aquaduct from river stream to lake so that water will be channelized to lake. In second step player will have to clean garbage from lake water to keep it clean. By cleaning objects from lake layer will get points. Once player has reached preconfiured points then the level is cleared. 
<br>
Initial Scene where player can see four puzzle pieces which can be used to build an aquaduct. Also player can see.
<ul>
  <li>Time Remaining</li>
   <li>Score/li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Joy Stick to move player in all direction</li>
</ul>
